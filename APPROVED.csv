Også inden for individuelle sportsgrene, såsom tennis, golf, atletik eller svømning, er der mulighed for et stærkt socialt fællesskab. Man træner sammen, deler erfaringer og støtter hinanden i jagten på bedre personlige rekorder.

In 2005, 22% of the company shares were sold to CVC Capital Partners, 3.5% of the company shares were partly sold to employees at a discount, partly kept in reserve for a management incentives program. In 2009, it was merged with the Swedish Posten AB to form PostNord, a joint postal service company between Denmark and Sweden. As of 2007, Post Danmark employed about 21,000 people, and delivered approximately a billion letters and 37 million parcels every year. Post Danmark has a wide variety of services, such as express deliveries (ensured delivery by no later than 9 am the following morning), courier services, facility services, 10 o'clock service (ensured delivery no later than 10 am every day), and electronic mailbox (mail scanned electronically and sent by email instead of by regular post).","E-commerce | Postal Service | Courier Service | Transportation & Logistics | Third-party Logistics",491110,"Postal Service",492110,"Couriers and Express Delivery Services","Postal Service","Warehousing, Logistics & Support","Transport & Warehousing","Air Freight & Logistics","TR-AF","Air Transportation","TR.1","Transportation","TR","7389 | 4311","Business Services, NEC (post office contract stations) | United States Postal Service",NA,"5310","Postal activities","53.1","Postal activities under universal service obligation",NA,4526663903,"+4520241209 | +4570218075 | +4570101300 | +4526663903 | +4520241127 | +4520241206 | +4520241123 | +4570707605 | +4520241031 | +4570602230 | +4550009999 | +4520220505","dkkundeservice@postnord.com",NA,NA,"https://www.postnord.dk/","postnord.dk","dk","da","https://www.facebook.com/PostNordDK/","https://twitter.com/postnorddk","https://www.instagram.com/postnorddk/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/post-danmark","https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/id396871673","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.postnord.private",NA,NA,"javascript frameworks: socket.io | performance: azure monitor | javascript libraries: lodash | javascript frameworks: requirejs | ui frameworks: pure css | analytics: microsoft application insights | ui frameworks: bootstrap | paas: azure | web servers: empathy platform | web frameworks: bootstrap | miscellaneous: webpack | javascript libraries: slick | issue trackers: sentry | ssl/tls certificate authorities: digicert | miscellaneous: parcel | widgets: css | javascript libraries: lazysizes | web frameworks: microsoft asp.net | javascript frameworks: react | miscellaneous: pwa | miscellaneous: onetrust | a/b testing: google optimize 360 | cache tools: varnish | security: hsts | reverse proxies: nginx | miscellaneous: http/3 | video players: youtube | miscellaneous: optanon | databases: mysql | javascript frameworks: sweetalert | javascript frameworks: moment.js | cms: site.com | miscellaneous: open graph | web frameworks: pure css | javascript libraries: sweetalert | cookie compliance: onetrust | network devices: html | miscellaneous: jquery easing | cdn: jsdelivr | font scripts: font awesome | javascript libraries: jquery ui | operating systems: windows server | ecommerce: magento | seo tool: facebook friendly | programming languages: node.js | cms: optimizely content management | javascript frameworks: slick | network devices: html5 | analytics: azure monitor | ecommerce: cart functionality | web servers: iis | tag managers: google tag manager | ui frameworks: civictheme | javascript libraries: jquery | widgets: javascript | rum: microsoft application insights | seo tool: twitter friendly | web servers: nginx | cdn: cloudflare | programming languages: php | javascript libraries: jquery migrate | performance: lazysizes | reverse proxy: f5 bigip | javascript libraries: moment.js | javascript frameworks: jquery | javascript libraries: matter.js | analytics: google analytics",2019-11-24 10:47:14,2025-04-04 11:44:14.609,0,1,1,2,1
